# WordFindApp
### C# Console application where two players compete to get the best score by finding words in a board.  
  
This is a small .Net project to demonstrate the use of the framework and C# to build a console application with different classes while employing to diverse features of the language.  
Like value and reference types, accessibility modifiers (internal, private, public), overriding.  C# is a great tool to use for such projects as a way to make one's mind and skills to the test.  
Being a compiled strongly typed language, it does not allow for the kind of shenenigans as Python when it comes to variable types, access rigor.  
I enjoyed going out of my way to use fancy and fitting features to solve the challenges of this project.  
  
I implemented binary search and recursive algorithms to efficiently determine conditions for the game rules and used ressource embedding as well as 
one-file self-contained platform independant publish to out a single executable file that is able to run the application anywhere.
